= Coding Standards for SuiteCRM =

Some parts of the SuiteCRM code structure for PHP markup are inconsistent in their style.  
SuiteCRM are working to gradually improve this by helping our internal team and contributors maintain a consistent style so the code can become clean and easy to read at a glance.  
This will be an ongoing transition but we encourage users to begin to think about their supplied bug fixes and enhancements to conform to the below standards.  We thank you for your continued contributions!

= License =

At the beginning of each new '''core''' file include the following license as the standard header

Ensure that the if statement for the valid entry point has been moved to '''below''' the license.

&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre; 
white-space: -moz-pre; 
white-space: -pre; 
white-space: -o-pre;&quot;&gt;

if (!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) {
    die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
}

&lt;/pre&gt;

= Indentation =

Using PSR-2 Indentation.

Code MUST use an indent of &lt;u&gt;4 spaces&lt;/u&gt;, and MUST NOT use tabs for indenting.

JavaScript files should be indented using &lt;u&gt;2 spaces&lt;/u&gt;.

= Class Names =

Class names should use 'StudlyCaps' e.g ClassName, DoSomething.. Classes should be named relevant to their Entity.

Example:-
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre; 
white-space: -moz-pre; 
white-space: -pre; 
white-space: -o-pre;&quot;&gt;
class YoungInfant extends Person
{

}
&lt;/pre&gt;

= Function Names =

Function names should use lower camelCase e.g - functionName, doSomething.  Functions should also be named descriptively with preferably a verb in them.

Example:-
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre; 
white-space: -moz-pre; 
white-space: -pre; 
white-space: -o-pre;&quot;&gt;
function printLoginStatus($user, $time)
{
    // do Something
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

In function arguments the variables should be descriptive of the variables use.

= Variables =

Static and Member variables should be lower camelCase and do not abbreviate variable names un-necessarily.

Example:-
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre; 
white-space: -moz-pre; 
white-space: -pre; 
white-space: -o-pre;&quot;&gt;
public static $jobStrings;

var $disableRowLevelSecurity = true ;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Also ensure that uninitialised variables are checked if set by using the built-in isset() function.

Example:-
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre; 
white-space: -moz-pre; 
white-space: -pre; 
white-space: -o-pre;&quot;&gt;
if (isset($forum)) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

= Quotations =

Use single and double quotes when appropriate. If you’re not evaluating anything in the string, use single quotes.  There should be no need to ever escape quotes within a string.

Example:-
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre; 
white-space: -moz-pre; 
white-space: -pre; 
white-space: -o-pre;&quot;&gt;
$sample = 'Hello';
$sample = &quot;Hello, $name&quot;;
$sample = &quot;Hello, {$name}&quot;;
&lt;/pre&gt;

= Arrays =

When declaring indexed arrays with the Array function, a trailing space must be added after each comma delimiter to improve readability.

Example:-
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre; 
white-space: -moz-pre; 
white-space: -pre; 
white-space: -o-pre;&quot;&gt;
$sampleArray = array(1, 2, 3, 'Zend', 'Studio');
&lt;/pre&gt;
When declaring a multi-line indexed array the initial array item may begin on the following line.  If so, it should be padded at one indentation level greater than the line contain the array declaration, and all successive lines should have the same indentation; the closing parenthesis should be on a line by itself at the same indentation level as the line contain the array declaration.

Example:-
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre; 
white-space: -moz-pre; 
white-space: -pre; 
white-space: -o-pre;&quot;&gt;
$sampleArray = array( 
    1, 2, 3, 'Zend', 'Studio', 
    $a, $b, $c, 
    56.44, $d, 500, 
);
&lt;/pre&gt;
When declaring associative arrays the initial array item may begin on the following line.  If so, it should be padded at one indentation level greater than the line containing the array declaration, and all successive lines should have the same indentation; the closing parenthesis should be on a line by itself at the same indentation level as the line containing the array declaration.  For readability, the various &quot;=&gt;&quot; assignment operators should be padded such that they align.

Example:-
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre; 
white-space: -moz-pre; 
white-space: -pre; 
white-space: -o-pre;&quot;&gt;
$sampleArray = array( 
    'firstKey'  =&gt; 'firstValue', 
    'secondKey' =&gt; 'secondValue', 
);
&lt;/pre&gt;

= Brace Style =

'''Always include the braces''': Even if not required still maintain the braces to provide code clarity.

Bad:-
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre; 
white-space: -moz-pre; 
white-space: -pre; 
white-space: -o-pre;&quot;&gt;
if (condition) do_stuff(); 

if (condition)
    do_stuff(); 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Good:-
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre; 
white-space: -moz-pre; 
white-space: -pre; 
white-space: -o-pre;&quot;&gt;
if (condition) { 
    do_stuff(); 
} 

if($a != 2) { 
    $a = 2; 
} 
elseif($a == 3) { 
    $a = 4; 
} 
else { 
    $a = 7; 
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Opening bracket on class, function, method names should be on the next line as the declaration and the exiting bracket on a line of its own.

Example:-
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre; 
white-space: -moz-pre; 
white-space: -pre; 
white-space: -o-pre;&quot;&gt;
class ThisClass 
{
    public function newMethod()
    {

    }
}
function newFunction() 
{

}
&lt;/pre&gt;

= Comments =
Use [https://phpdoc.org/ phpdoc] syntax before all classes/methods/members/functions definitions.  A simple template can be set up in your IDE. 
 
* All class definitions should have at least @author and @package with the @author on the last line of the block-level comment
*Always start block-level comments containing phpdoc with two asterisks (/** ... */)
*Single commenting should have a space first, followed by a capital letter with no full stop needed &lt;code&gt;// This is an example&lt;/code&gt;

Often comment on any tricky, obscure, or otherwise not-immediately-obvious code to include any assumptions your code makes, or preconditions for its proper operation. A developer should be able to look at any part of the application and understand well enough what's going on in a reasonable amount of time.

Example:-
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre; 
white-space: -moz-pre; 
white-space: -pre; 
white-space: -o-pre;&quot;&gt;
/**
* The method's summary
* 
* This method's short description which can span
* along multiple lines – also provide context
* to the method.
* 
* @param string $variable with a description of this argument
* @return void
*/
public function myMethod($variable)
{
    // Do something here
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

= General Guidelines =
Any new class (including classed in generated files) should use the constructor __construct, but only where a constructor is required.  

Example:-
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre; 
white-space: -moz-pre; 
white-space: -pre; 
white-space: -o-pre;&quot;&gt;
function __construct()
{
    // do child class specific code here
    parent::__construct();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Ensure your code is compatible with current supported Databases and PHP versions - MySQL, MSSQL, PHP 5.5, PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.

Ensure your code is compatible with supported browsers – see our [[Compatibility_Matrix|wiki]].

= House Keeping =

If including JavaScript files, a minified version should be used in the core, with an un-minified version added to the equivalent directory within 'jssource' folder.  Any modifications to JavaScript files should be made in the 'jssource' folder and then minified into the core.

If developing a new core feature do not create files within the custom directory and ensure that the new module name is sensible and relevant with no prefixes.

If adding a new module clean up generated files so only the required files are used.  The following are examples (but not limited to) of tidying up a module's directory/files.

* Remove studio.php if it should not be in studio
* Remove '_sugar' class file from main class file if it not assignable 
* or in security groups remove the option from the vardefs and remove &lt;code&gt;// to ensure that modules created and deployed under CE will continue to function under team security if the instance is upgraded to PRO&lt;/code&gt;

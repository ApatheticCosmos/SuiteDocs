= Reports

This module allows you to quickly present these systems in the form of summary tables or graphs.

== Create a report

 .	In the module menu, select *Create bulletin*.
 .	Fill out the basic information:

Reports::  The name of the report being created.
Scope of analysis:: Select the data area on which the summary will be based. The proposed list items can be presented as a specific module (for example, Preliminary contacts), or at once by several modules (for example, Events presented by Calls, Meetings and Tasks) and allow you to compile quite complex summary reports.
Configuration:: It is represented by two combo boxes and data fields. In the first combo box, you can choose how to present data in the form of various types of tables or charts. In the second combo box, a function is selected that determines how exactly the selected data will be processed. The list of available fields depends on the selected area of ​​analysis. By moving data fields in the information area of ​​the summary, you can specify which data will be presented in rows and columns of the pivot table (or on the x-axis and ordinate, if the data are presented as a cumulative graph).

Example:

Suppose you need to view a summary of all contractors entered into the system, taking into account their types and countries of location. For this:

 * In the analysis area, select *Accounts*.
 * In the configuration, select the field *Account type* and move it to the header of the future table.
 * In the configuration, select the *Country* field and move it to the left of the first column of the future table.
 * In the first combo box, specify the method of data presentation, for example, the heat map.
 * In the second combo box, select the function *Quantity*.
